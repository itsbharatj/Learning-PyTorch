'''
We have a PyTorch Dataset, which we need to get some transformations applied. 

For this: 

1. Our Dataset Class: 
    - Add the transforms feature

2. Make the tranform classes: 
    - For Multiplication 
    - For Addition

3. Apply these tranformations and check it with the output that we have recieved

4. Apply a combined tranformation using the composed method of torchvision

5. Check that as well with the output that we have recieved
